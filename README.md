<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
#  Document Digitalization <a name="about-project"></a>
## Challenge Description
The challenge proposed by IDISK was to automate the translation of official Mexican documents using AI. The current manual process is labor-intensive, so our goal was to automate key tasks to optimize the service for translators and clients. Key requirements included recognizing diverse document types, creating editable text versions, identifying non-textual elements, and ensuring high reliability.

## Final Implementation
The final project pipeline involves converting each document page into a PNG image. We used a model called docTR for text extraction and developed a custom algorithm for figure detection and classification. Interaction between the algorithm and the user is facilitated through a Gradio web app. Users can upload a document, supervise the results, and download the finalized version.
